        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Here is a range of my work in the media field. The home page is all my work from uni and the second page will be more independent work that I have done.</h2>
        <h2>Here is the photography section of my work</h2>
        <h3>In this section I am going to be showing a range of techniques I have 
        used and I will also explain the reasons I used them.</h3>
        <!--Hear I used a range of headings to make the top of the page stand out more aginst the rest, the use of these made my title clearer and made it stand out.-->
        
   

<p>Some examples of the techniques I used are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depth of field</li>
            <li>Shutter speeed</li>
            <li>Leading lines</li>
            <li>Image manipulation</li>
        </ul>
<!--for this part of the site I decided to use bullet points to show the range of photography work, I also did this because it made the information stand out a bit as ot looked different that the rest.-->

        
            <p>Here are some of my favourit images that I have taken with some
            information about what I focused on when I was taking the images.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of what I focused on:</p>
        
        <img class="photography" src="IMG_1542.JPG" alt="WATERFALL">
        


        <p class="des">In this image I lowered the shutter speed so I could capture the movement
        on the water, as well as that in this Image there is a contrast of colors with 
        the green grass and the grey rocks, this is a image I wanted to include this image as 
        not only do the colors present a contrast, but the image is using a rule of thirds so 
        they layout is very satisfying.  
</p>

<img class="photography" src="IMG_8772.JPG" alt="guitar">


           <p class="des">When taking this image the main focus I had was on my depth of field and the
            lighting in the studio as this was one of the first studio images I had taken.  
</p>



<img class="photography" src="IMG_4037.JPG">
      

       <p class="des">This was an exersize I used to help me with my focus, I had to make sure the camera was
          focused on one point of the image.</p>


          <h2>Here is the radio section of my work</h2>

    <p class="des"> This is a part of the couse I really enjoyed as I have always had an intrest in radio but I've never had the chance to do it before. </p>

<!--For this I coded the audio into the page, as well as this I added a message for if the browser doesnt support the file it gives a brif description of what the file is.-->

<h2>Here is the film section of my uni work.</h2>
<p>This is a advert I created in the film section of the course, this was a really fun project as I was able to experement with the different camera angles and also got to play around with the editing software.</p>
