    <h2> This is where I am going to be showing some if the work I have done independently in the past.</h2>

    <p>I decided to do these independent shoots for a few different reasons some of which are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I got to experement with styles I wouldn't have in a lesson.</li>
        <li>I was able to choose what I wanted to do with the images.</li>
        <li>The different images made my personal portfolio have a wider range.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--This is another list that highlights information on the page.-->

<P>This was more of a post-production element as I had 3D Image manipulation, this meant that I went into photoshop and placed the image on a cube net and moved the different sides around so it would all line up once folded into a cube.

<p>Here is an example my work when I was focused on the sutter speed, this shows the movement of the sparkeler, this was a fun experemnt as I was able to play with many different shapes and different settings on the camera.</p>

<p> This image is one of my favourite images I have ever taken, mainly becasue of the story behing the image but also because of the main point of focus being the track and then following the leading lines rule leading to the brifge.</p>
